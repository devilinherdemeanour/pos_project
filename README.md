# Principle of Operating Systems Project - CPU scheduling algorithm simulator

This project is partial fulfillment of the requirements of the CSCI 3510: Principles of Operating Systems course

There are 6 Python files. `fcfs.py`, `rr.py` and `srtf.py` refer to algorithm structures, `process.py` is a class 
that shows the structure of each process and `file.py` creates "txt" files that shows the outputs of each algorithm.

All of the logic is executed in `main.py`.
